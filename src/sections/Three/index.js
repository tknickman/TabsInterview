        "To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the
        soul!" How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was sick to
        death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent blood had
        been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there was no
        atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness was
        possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing out,
        to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one. Indeed,
        what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done? Who had made
        him a judge over others? He had said things that were dreadful,
        horrible, not to be endured.
